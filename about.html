      Hello! I'm Josh George, a passionate developer and computer science enthusiast currently pursuing my degree at Fairmont State University, with an expected graduation in May 2025. I love solving problems, building software, and continuously learning new technologies. My goal is to create efficient, user-friendly applications and contribute to meaningful projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm a devoted family man. Caring for my children and spending time with my family is at the heart of everything I do. Balancing my love for development and my role as a parent motivates me to work harder and aim higher in every aspect of my life.
