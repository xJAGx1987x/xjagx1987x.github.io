        I'm Joshua George, an aspiring software engineer currently completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Fairmont State University, with an expected graduation in May 2025. I thrive on solving complex problems, developing efficient code, and quickly mastering new technologies to deliver user-focused solutions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm eager to bring my strong technical foundations, adaptability, and collaborative mindset to a professional environment. My academic projects and personal initiatives have equipped me with experience in Java, C++, and Python, as well as front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm committed to creating impactful software that enhances user experiences and meets organizational goals.
