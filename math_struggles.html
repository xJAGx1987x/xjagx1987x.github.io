        This project examines the influence of socioeconomic status and family dynamics on math success among STEM students at Fairmont State University.
      </p>
      <p class="key-findings">Key findings include:</p>
      <ul class="findings-list">
        <li>Socioeconomic status and family expectations were found to be the largest drivers of academic and mathematical success among STEM students.</li>
        <li>Students from supportive family environments demonstrated a higher likelihood of visiting tutoring centers, engaging with their coursework, and feeling more prepared for college challenges.</li>
        <li>Figure 1 illustrates the demographics of surveyed students, including sex and college status, providing key insights into the composition of the study sample.</li>
        <li>Figure 2 highlights the frequency of tutoring visits by subject, revealing significant disparities in tutoring engagement between mathematics and other STEM disciplines during the 2022–2023 academic year.</li>
        <li>Principal Component Analysis (Figure 3) identified variability across students based on socioeconomic background, family dynamics, and educational preparedness, with outliers generally corresponding to students who did not answer all questions.</li>
        <li>Figure 4 shows how student perceptions of math and science correlate with socioeconomic status and family dynamics. Students with higher parental education levels and stable family dynamics reported more positive attitudes toward STEM.</li>
        <li>K–12 spending rates (Figure 5) indicate that regional differences in educational investment impact students’ foundational preparedness for college-level math and science.</li>
      </ul>
